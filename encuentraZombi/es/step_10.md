## Safety when playing the game

When you play a GPS-based game, it is important that you remain safe. Follow our tips to make sure you create a fun and safe game to play with your friends.

+ Set up your game map in an open area such as a park, so that you can have as much fun as possible exploring.

+ Don't add markers in places which are difficult or dangerous to reach, such as in the middle of roads or near the edges of cliffs. Make your goodies tricky to find, but not deadly.

+ If you find you have accidentally placed a marker inside somewhere which is private property, don't trespass, leave it alone. Just change your code for the next time you play!

+ Get permission from a parent or guardian to play the game and make sure they are having fun playing with you or know where you are.

+ Remember to turn off location services on your phone after playing so that you don't accidentally share your location data online with other apps.

+ Always play during the day, in well-lit areas. Zombies are rather keen on the dark...
