## What you will make
The version of Scratch included with the Raspberry Pi has a number of unique features; one of the most useful is its ability to communicate with the GPIO pins (General Purpose Input Output). These pins allow you to connect your Raspberry Pi to a range of devices, from lights and motors to buttons and sensors. The original Raspberry Pi had a 26-pin header and newer models (B+, Pi 2, Pi 3, etc) have a 40-pin header, but this workshop will work with any model.

## What you will learn
By completing this resource you will learn:

- How to control the GPIO pins using Scratch
- How to receive input from the GPIO pins using Scratch

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
