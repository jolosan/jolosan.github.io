## Buzzers

There are two main types of buzzer: **active** and **passive**.

A passive buzzer emits a tone when a voltage is applied across it. It also requires a specific signal to generate a variety of tones. The active buzzers are a lot simpler to use, so these are covered here.

### Connecting a buzzer

An active buzzer can be connected just like an LED, but as they are a little more robust, you won't be needing a resistor to protect them.

Set up the circuit as shown below:

### Coding a buzzer

Now you can sound the buzzer by using the code below:

Or even make the buzzer beep:
