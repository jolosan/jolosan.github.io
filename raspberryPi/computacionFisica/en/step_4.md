## Lighting an LED

You can test whether your GPIO pins and LEDs are working by building the circuit below. You can use any resistor over about 50Î©.

- The LED is connected directly to the **GND** pin and the **3V3** pin via the 330 Ohm resistor, and should light up.

- Be sure to connect your LED the correct way round; the longer leg should be connected to the 3V3 pin:
